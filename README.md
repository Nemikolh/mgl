You will need the following additionals librairies:

* GLEW
* glm

Note that the librairie isn't in alpha yet. Several features will likely be changed over the next months.
The dependencies on GLEW will probably be removed over time.
However, the dependency on [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) won't change as mgl has been thought to be well integrated with glm.
