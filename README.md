mgl
===

mgl is a meta programming library for OpenGL.
That is, this library offers simpler way to perform OpenGL calls and manipulating OpenGL objects.

Install
-------

You will need the following additionals librairies:

* GLEW
* glm
* Boost.Fusion
* Boost.MPL
* Boost.Preprocessor
* Boost.TypeTraits

Note that the librairie isn't in alpha yet. Several features will likely be changed over the next months.
The dependencies on GLEW and Boost will probably be removed over time.
However, the dependency on [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) won't change as mgl has been thought to be well integrated with glm.
